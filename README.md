Swift - Swift Map View App Demo - Demo 23 of 30

App created in Xcode 11.0 using Swift 5.0, iOS Deployment Target 13.0 and tested on a iPhone 11 Pro Max Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a Swift Map View Application.

There are so many interesting things within swift. This demo shows one way to code a swift Map View Application. There are
some pretty interesting things you can do with Apple's map within your application. The user clicks the demo icon and is 
taken right into the app. To a Hybrid (Standard/Satellite) map view of the Willis Tower in Chicago. You can see a color 
aerial view looking down on downtown Chicago long with some street and location information. 

The next view the user can see a Standard View with a pin designating the location of the Willis Tower along with its 
address location. The pin is red in color with a pin graphic shown within the red circle object. Then we see how we can zoom
in on the area to see more details of the sourding buildings and structures.

Now we get into what happens when you click the 'Locate' button on the bottom right. The user is prompted with a request
message to allow access to our location. In the demo we placed it at a nearby downtown Chicago spot.
