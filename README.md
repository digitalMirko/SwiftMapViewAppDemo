Swift - Swift Map View App Demo - Demo 23 of 30

App created in Xcode 11.0 using Swift 5.0, iOS Deployment Target 13.0 and tested on a iPhone 11 Pro Max Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a Swift Map View Application.

There are so many interesting things within Swift. This demo shows one way to code a Swift Map View Application. There are
some pretty interesting things you can do with Apple's map within your application. The user clicks the demo icon and is 
taken right into the app. They come to a title on top 'Map View' then to the right a 'Directions' button. This button 
when clicked gives your directions from where you currenlty are to the default location that is displayed initially as
the app starts. Right below the top bar is running a Hybrid (Standard/Satellite) map view of the Willis Tower in Chicago. 

You can see a color aerial view looking down on downtown Chicago long with some street and location information. 
Then right below on the bottom bar we see 4 buttons (3 on the left, 1 on the right). The three on the left demonstrate 
a few options available for types of Maps views. Note there are more options then these three. The three options used
are 'Standard' view which shows a map view of the area. Then a 'Satellite' view which shows a color view looking down
on the details and buildings. Followed by a 'Hybrid' view which is a combination of 'Standard' and 'Hybrid' views together.

On the right is one button 'Locate'. This is designed to locate where you are on the map. When clicked it will go to that
area, marking your location with an animated blue pin. When the buttons require your location information prompts are setup
to ask you to allow this feature or it will not be shown.

In the demo screen caps shown below we go though a number of various options such as the application launching. The Map 
View pin(red ballon with pin graphic within) where the default subject (Willis Tower) is displayed with location information under various views. Then when the 'Locate' button is clicked, asking for you to allow access to your location. Followed by 
a pin showing your position if you allow it too. Then using the 'Directions' button to give you directions from your current
location after you allow it permission to see it to the Willis town in a step by step break down.
